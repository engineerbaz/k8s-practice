I used following aliases to save typing commands.
export ns=default
alias k='kubectl -n $ns' # This helps when namespace in question doesn't have a friendly name 
alias kdr='kubectl -n $ns -o yaml --dry-run'.  # run commands in dry run mode and generate yaml.
However, do remember that you sometimes need to do ssh to a node or switch to root user. In that case, make sure you set the aliases properly.


3. VIM settings
K8s imperative commands wonâ€™t help in a few cases and you will have to write/edit YAMLs. E.g. For questions related to Persistent Volumes or Network Policies etc. I used following VIM settings to convert tabs to spaces and other syntax related help
vim ~/.vimrc
set nu
set expandtab
set shiftwidth=2
set tabstop=2


 alias k=kubectl
alias cc=clear
source <(kubectl completion bash)

source <(kubectl completion bash | sed 's/kubectl/k/g' )
